    "HowToAcknowledge": "Data was acquired at Scannexus (Maastricht, the Netherlands). We thank Chris Wiggins for providing the 3rd order shimming tools used here. We thank Federico DeMartino for discussions on the analysis of event-related fMRI data. We thank Vojtěch Smekal for helpful discussions on the manuscript. Special thanks goes to the remaining “Maastricht layer-seminar” members Lonike Faes, Miriam Heynckes, Kenshu Koiso, Alessandra Pizzuti and Yawen Wang for countless discussions on topics related to layer-fMRI. We thank Benedikt Poser for kindly sharing his 3D-EPI sequence code used here and helpful advice on layer-fMRI VASO optimization and reconstructions. Finally, we thank Dr. Amanda Kaas, who was supervising Sebastian Dresbach in the beginning of this project and provided the piezo-electric stimulation setup.\n\nSebastian Dresbach is supported by the ‘Robin Hood’ fund of the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience and the department of Cognitive Neuroscience. Laurentius Huber was funded by the NWO VENI project016.Veni.198.03 and the York-Maastricht Partnership. Scan time was kindly provided by Maastricht University Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience via the intramural MBIC funding scheme. Rainer Goebel is partly funded by the European Research Council Grant ERC-2010-AdG269853 and Human Brain Project Grant FP7-ICT-2013-FET-F/604102. We thank Brain Innovation for supporting this project and for funding Omer Faruk Gulban while working on it.",
